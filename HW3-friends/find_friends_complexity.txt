There are three steps in this algorithm
1. Find the all prime numbers from 0 to n
   the time complexity is O((n**0.5)loglogn)
   the space complexity is theta (n)

2. Find the sum of divisors for each number from 0 to n
   the time complexity is O(nloglogn)
   the space complexity is theta (n)

3. Find the amicable pairs between 0 to n
   the time complexity is theta (n)
   the space complexity is theta(n)
