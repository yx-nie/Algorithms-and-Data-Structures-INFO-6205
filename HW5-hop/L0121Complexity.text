1) _nsquare_time_constant_space
The time complexity is O(n^2), as for each i, it will compared with every element after i, the complexity is
(n-1) + (n-2) +(n-3)+......+3+2+1, which has the worst case n square
the space complexity is theta 1, as we only need to use i and j in each iteration

2) _nlogn_time_logn_space
The time complexity is Theta nlogn, as for each recursion, all the element will be compared. And there will be logn time recursion.
Therefore, the time complexity if theta nlogn
the space complexity is theta logn, as until there are result returned, otherwise, we need to store each recursion in the stack.


3) _ntime_constant_space
The time complexity is Theta n, as for each i, we will compare it with the minimum before i, and the minimum will be updated at each step.
We will go through all the i until n, therefore, the tiem complexity is theta n
the space complexity is theta 1, as we space to store maximum and minimum, as well as the sellday buyday.
